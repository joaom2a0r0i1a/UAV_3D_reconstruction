# RRT Construction

This package implements the core sampling-based planning methods, including the Kinodynamic RRT (KRRT), RRT, and RRT*. These methods are used by the planning algorithms to generate possible viewpoints. It also includes the gain evaluation function, responsible for calculating the expected information gain about the environment at each node.
